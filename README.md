**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**:

The **Customer Churn Prediction** project is an end-to-end data science and machine learning application designed to identify customers who are likely to leave a business. This type of predicitive modelling is essential for organisations such as banks, telecom companies, and subscription-based businesses, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

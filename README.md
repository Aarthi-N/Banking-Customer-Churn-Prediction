**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**:

The **Customer Churn Prediction** project is an end-to-end data science and machine learning application designed to identify customers who are likely to leave a business. This type of predicitive modelling is essential for organisations such as banks, telecom companies, and subscription-based businesses, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

**TOOLS & LIBRARIES USED**:

The project was implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Several key python libraries were used:

  * **Pandas**: for data loading, cleaning and manipulation. It helped in handling the CSV dataset and performing tabular operations.
  * **Numpy**: used for numerical computations, array operations and statistical analysis.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). They help in plotting churn distribution, feature correlations and customer behaviour trends.
